This is a fork of https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx aimed simply at providing a simple way
to perform a "unity" or "single translation unit" build of the entire bgfx library.
Having a fork provides an easier way to see any changes and maintain updates over time.

See commit history for additional changes to files in this repo.

All files are under their original licenses as indicated in corresponding subfolders.

An example (basically bgfx hello world example 00) using SDL is available under the SDL_Example folder.

For the extremely small set of files directly in the root of this folder (not in subfolders),
feel free to do whatever you want with them (I don't really case, so you could consider them in the public domain).
